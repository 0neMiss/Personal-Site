                    <p class="text-lg">Hi I'm Jordan Shehane, a web developer based out of Newport News Virginia. I was working in device repair and I loved it, but it turns out I love software a lot more. I wanted to make a career change, so I ended up attending part time classes at Lambda School. My specialties are MERN and SERN stacks but I have experience with a lot of different technologies. In the components section you can find a library of different animations, buttons, and other frontend components I've built, and I've included links to the code as well as what different libraries I used to make them.  Outside of programming I like to rock climb, and I play jazz piano. </p>
